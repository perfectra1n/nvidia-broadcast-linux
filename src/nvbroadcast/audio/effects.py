"""Audio noise removal.

Two engines, best-available by default:
- DeepFilterNet3 (streaming ONNX): modern full-band neural denoiser, the
  same class of model as NVIDIA Broadcast's noise removal. ~0.6ms per
  10ms hop on CPU. Selected when engine is "auto" and the model
  initializes; see audio/deepfilter.py.
- RNNoise via pyrnnoise: lightweight fallback, always initialized so a
  DeepFilterNet failure can never leave noise removal silently dead.
